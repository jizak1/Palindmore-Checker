I have successfully built a Palindrome Checker as part of the JavaScript Algorithms and Data Structures certification on freeCodeCamp. This project features an interactive web application that allows users to input a word or phrase and determine whether it is a palindromeâ€”meaning it reads the same forward and backward, ignoring punctuation, case, and spacing.

    User-friendly Interface: A modern, visually appealing design with a smooth glassmorphism effect for a clean and stylish look.
    Real-time Input Handling: Users can check for palindromes by clicking the "Check" button or pressing "Enter" for seamless interaction.
    Efficient Palindrome Algorithm:
        Removes all non-alphanumeric characters using regular expressions (Regex).
        Converts the input to lowercase for case-insensitive comparison.
        Reverses the cleaned string and checks for equality to determine if it's a palindrome.
    Animated Result Display: The result message smoothly appears with a fade-in and scaling effect to enhance user experience.
    3D Interactive Effect: The entire container slightly rotates based on mouse movement, adding a dynamic visual touch.
    Responsive Design: The layout adapts perfectly to different screen sizes, ensuring usability across devices.
    CSS Enhancements:
        Glassmorphism effect with a blurred translucent background.
        Hover and focus effects for a more interactive feel.
        Gradient background for a visually appealing aesthetic.
